When a variable has no effect in most groups, but has an effect in one group.
Looks like no effect in the whole population

```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r functions}
noisy_line <- function(slope, intercept, n, group_label) {
  
  n = n - 1
  
  data.frame(x = 0:n / n * 10, eps = rnorm(n + 1, 0, 1)) %>%
    mutate(y = slope * x + intercept + eps,
           group_label = group_label) -> df
  
  return(df)
  
}
```

```{r test}
df <- noisy_line(1, 1, 20, 'hi')

qplot(df$x, df$y)

```
